# How to deploy vault to the cluster
## 1. DB secret craetion ðŸ”’
After the cluster has been setup you will need to crate a secret manually that connects vault to the database.

Create a namespace "vault" navigate to the location of the secret and run `kubectl apply -f vault-db-creds-secret.yaml`

This should create a secret that is required by vault

## 2. Deploy argocd ðŸ¤–
The next step is to deploy argocd and the app-of-apps. To do that simple run `kubectl apply -k gitops/components/argocd` This should take care of deploying argocd. However, you will also need to deploy the app-of-apps. To do that apply app-of-apps app like so `kubectl apply -f gitops/apps/app-of-apps/app.yml`

Give it a few minutes and the entire cluster should be up and running

## 3. Unlocking vault ðŸ”“
The last bit is to unlock vault, after argocd has been ran, check the pods on the cluster, there should be pods named like `vault-0`, exec into a vault and run the following command: `vault operator init` this should output 5 unseal keys as well as a root token.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Make sure to save those keys and the root token somewhere safe like Keeper

After that is done run `vault operator unseal` when promted enter the unseal key, repeat this process 3 times (each time using a new key) until the vault is unsealed.

*the commands will look like so*

```
vault operator init

<output of the keys and a root toke>

vault operator unseal
<inputy key 1>

vault operator unseal
<input key 2>

vault operator unseal
<input key 3>

exit
```

After the first pod is unsealed it should come online. Repeat the process for all remaining pods but **DON'T RUN `vault operator init`**

*So the commands for other pods will look like so*
```
vault operator unseal
<inputy key 1>

vault operator unseal
<input key 2>

vault operator unseal
<input key 3>

exit
```

At this point you should have configured vault and it should be reachable on https://secrets.isis.rl.ac.uk for vault and for argoCD use https://argo.secrets.isis.rl.ac.uk
